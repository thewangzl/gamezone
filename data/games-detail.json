    "how_to_play": "<p>Each level of this game is more or less the same, but what varies greatly is the difficulty level. You are a gold miner and are positioned at the top of the game with a crane and hook to grab as many valuable objects as possible. Some of the objects you will want to target are gold chunks, diamonds, animals carrying diamonds, money bags, and more. There are also nonprecious metals surrounding the gold and diamonds - that's where your skill comes into play. You will need to avoid them either or capture them strategically -- yes, you can get these too, though they are of very little value, so they are mostly obstacles and time wasters. </p><p><strong>Not All That Glimmers Is Gold</strong></p><p>Well, in this case, all that glimmers is pretty much gold, but not all gold chunks have the same value. Some of the heavier pieces may be worth $500 or more, but some of the same size may be worth significantly less. This is why you need to grab as much as possible to meet your target. When in doubt -- go for the diamonds. You can't go (too) wrong with diamonds.</p><p><strong>Every Level Has A Monetary Goal</strong></p><p>Each level has a monetary goal. The first round goal is to collect $650 worth of precious stones and metals. This is easy enough if you keep your eye on the prize, but as the levels increase, the amount of money you need to make from gold and precious stones to complete the level keeps increasing, so a bit of skill is necessary.</p><p><strong>The Shop In Between Levels</strong></p><p>Between each level, you will be met with a shopkeeper trying to sell you different items to help you at the next level. Prices vary significantly. Sometimes, a high price can indicate that you may need to use the item in the next round. Sometimes, the shopkeeper is just scamming you with jacked-up prices.</p><p>Monetary rewards are cumulative, so you carry over what you made in the previous round to the next round. If you have plenty of money to spare and have reached or nearly reached your goal for the next round, splurge on some of the higher-priced items. You may be able to increase your earnings significantly.</p><p>Some shop items include:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Rock collectors book: </strong>Rocks will be worth three times as much in the round you use this ointment. It is only good for one level.</li>\n<li><strong>Lucky clover: </strong>This will increase the chances of getting something good out of the grab bags to the next level. This is only good for one level.</li>\n<li><strong>Strength drink: </strong>Gives the miner more strength to pull up objects.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamite: </strong>After you've grabbed onto something with your claw, press the up key to throw a piece of dynamite at it to blow it up.</li>\n<li><strong>Diamond polish:</strong> Diamonds are worth more when buying this at the next level.</li>\n</ul><p>This game can be addictive, so be warned!</p>"

Still available in its original form today, you can explore the ingenious levels created by players and try out various characters in the game.</p><h3>Levels</h3><p>You can play through various original and user-created levels in Happy Wheels. There are countless selections to choose from, some of which are easier to play through with certain characters. Depending on the level, you could find yourself riding your wheelchair through someone's stomach or plowing through a forest on an angry cat.</p><p>The goal of each level varies, from reaching the end to collecting all the tokens. Some levels are entirely aimless. You can also design your own tracks and share them with the rest of the world for testing.</p><h3>Happy Wheels Characters</h3><h4>The Original 4</h4><p>The characters in Happy Wheels are far from conventional in a platformer. Instead of having superpowers, you're pretty much a regular guy. The first character is Wheelchair Guy, a slightly ragged-looking older man in a jet-powered wheelchair. As you can imagine, a jet-powered wheelchair is pretty tough to control without causing severe injury.</p><p>Segway Guy, on the other hand, is a bit more manageable and a common choice among seasoned Happy Wheels gamers. The other two original game characters are Irresponsible Dad (who rather irresponsibly has his kid on the back seat) and Effective Shopper, who rides a mobility scooter.</p><p>Each character in Happy Wheels has an ability unique to them. Segway Guy can jump, and Wheelchair Guy can turbo-boost his jet thrusters to move faster. Learn more about the Happy Wheels <a href=\"https://happywheels.fandom.com/wiki/Characters\" target=\"_blank\">character abilities</a>.</p><h4>Newer Characters</h4><p>As Happy Wheels continued to provide endless gory entertainment for the gaming world, several new characters were released. These include the creatively named Moped Couple, Lawnmower Man, Explorer Guy, Santa Claus, Pogo Stick Man, Irresponsible Mom, and Helicopter Man.</p>"

Papa Louie has scammed you into working at one of his restaurants. You are now contractually obligated to fry tasty wings for Papa’s Wingeria. He’ll start you with the basic skills, and you’ll work your way up from there.</p><h4>Add a tasteful amount of sauce.</h4><p>Fry the requested amount of wings until they reach the line. Place the wings into the wing-spinner 3000 and load up the requested sauce. There are various sauces Wingeria patrons love, so it’s essential to time your saucing and wing-whizzing precisely. There’s nothing worse than not having enough sauce. </p><h4>Spread your wings.</h4><p>This is the final stage. Spread your wings neatly around the plate and add all the required extras! Some customers like to convince themselves that having a few celery sticks makes it a healthy meal. Serve it with a chef’s kiss, but not literally. That could land you in trouble.</p><h4>Unwind after a day in the chicken shop.</h4><p>After each day’s shift, you’ll get 3 tickets to play in one of the various minigames. You could be shooting targets, catching burgers, or any of the other minigames. If you succeed at the challenge, you’ll be rewarded with something to help you in the game. You can also use your tips to buy new items for the restaurant.</p><h4>From Wingeria to Bling-eria.</h4><p>Decorative items like tables and posters help improve customer waiting time, while upgrades to the equipment can make the food prep process easier and faster. Eventually, the shop floor will be kitted entirely with new furniture, flooring, walls, all the bells and whistles. You have to earn them first, though!</p><h3>Features</h3><ul>\n<li>Pick a character or build your own</li>\n<li>Fry wings and serve them in a presentable fashion</li>\n<li>Play fun minigames to unlock items after a hard day’s work</li>\n<li>Upgrade Papa’s Wingeria with all of the finest furnishings</li>\n</ul><h3>Release Date</h3><ul>\n<li>June 2012 (Flash)</li>\n<li>August 2014 (iOS)</li>\n<li>February 2019 (Android)</li>\n</ul><h3>Developer</h3><p>Flipline Studios made Papa's Wingeria.

It's especially magical when you pop a big group of them.</p><h3>Enjoy the Ambiance</h3><p>The sound effects and music work together to create the ideal experience for a bubble-shooting enthusiast. You can choose from a selection of four musical tracks any time you want to shift the mood. </p><h3>Play Endlessly</h3><p>Some bubble shooting games feature a multitude of easy levels. Not Smarty Bubbles. This game is the classic ‘endless’ type and is quite challenging compared to similar games.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>The bubbles move further down the screen, so you have to pop faster and not allow one side to be overwhelmed with a high quantity of multi-colored bubbles. Try to pop evenly and go for the biggest clusters. You can also bounce the bubbles off the walls to get into hard-to-reach locations, often referred to as bubble ravines.</p><h2>More Games Like This</h2><p>There’s an array of <a href=\"https://www.crazygames.com/c/casual\" target=\"_blank\">casual games</a> to choose from on CrazyGames.

    "how_to_play": "<p>You start Drift Hunters by choosing your car and type of ride. You can upgrade the performance, including the brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine, with superior parts. You can also finish off your car in any color and enjoy a selection of rims on the house. </p><p><strong>Race Tracks: </strong>Drift through diverse circuits like Nishuri, Stadium, Tyshen, and more. Each track offers a unique layout with varied curves and turns, challenging your drifting skills to the max.</p><p><strong>Cars:</strong> Rack up at least 8,500 points to start unlocking cars, with the top model costing over 134k points. Every drift and upgrade gets you closer to that dream ride!</p><p>Drift Hunters available cars</p><ul>\n<li>BMW M3</li>\n<li>Toyota Supra</li>\n<li>Honda S2000</li>\n<li>Ford Fiesta ST</li>\n<li>Nissan 370Z coupe</li>\n<li>Dodge Challenger Hellcat</li>\n<li>Nissan GTR</li>\n<li>Porsche 911 GT</li>\n<li>And 18 more cars...</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Parts &amp; Upgrades: </strong>Customize your vehicle’s performance with upgrades to brakes, weight, gearbox, turbo, and engine.</p><p><strong>Tuning: </strong>Adjust your car’s fine-tuning settings—including front and rear camber, offset, brake balance, height, and brake pressure—to perfect your drift style even without additional upgrades.</p><p><strong>Visuals:</strong> Express your style by changing the color of your car’s body and rims, and choose from a variety of rim designs to complete your look. Every car you buy can be fully tuned — turbo, brake balance, front camber, rear offset, and more. You can fully modify these values to find the best tuning for your drift performance.</p><p>Some tracks allow you to keep drifting much easier than others. The best tracks for drifting in Drift Hunters 2 are Emashi and Forest because of their long corners and lack of too many sharp turns. The Forest track has the longest corners for the most prolonged drifts.</p><p>The longer you drift, the more your points multiplier increases. You can use the points to buy exotic motors like the high-performance Porsche 911 GT. There are 26 fully customizable cars available to buy in total. </p><p>Drift Hunters has a smooth arcade-racer feel but isn’t constrained to a racing format. Instead, you can blaze your own trail in several locations, racking up points to buy new cars and upgrades. The graphics are great for the web, but you can play the game on low-spec devices without a hiccup. It’s a must-play for drift enthusiasts!</p><h3>Tips</h3><ul>\n<li>Use acceleration cautiously when approaching corners mid-drift</li>\n<li>Drift from side to side on straight roads to keep the drift alive</li>\n<li>Tune up your vehicles to find the sweet spot for maximum drift</li>\n<li>Drive on maps with plenty of space for long, uninterrupted drifting</li>\n</ul>"

Once you have a complete ascending order, you can place these cards in the upper right corner. There is a hidden stockpile at the top left of the screen, which you can choose to display one or three cards, but only one will be available for movement at a time.</p><p>You will want to strategically move the uncovered stockpile card onto one of the seven tableau columns, depending on whether it can be placed in ascending order. You can drag cards to move them onto the seven tableau columns or to the four foundations. Remember that the seven columns only allow for alternating colors to be placed in ascending order.</p><p>For building rules, cards in the foundations must be stacked by the same suit in ascending order, from Ace to King. In the tableau, cards need to be stacked in alternating colors, from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Additionally, any empty spots in the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.</p><p>As the deck is shuffled in random order, you must carefully strategize to find the correct moves as you reveal cards one by one. This is the essence of the solitaire challenge.</p><p>You can move either single cards or piles of cards within the tableau, but you can only move cards from the waste pile. Whenever you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card will automatically turn face-up for you.</p>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>The objective of Go Chicken Go! is fairly simple. You must get a flock of chickens across two three-lane highways and a river with moving logs. Well, perhaps not so simple after all. An arrow will point at the chicken you will be tasked to help across the road. The arrow keys help move the chicken up, down, left, and right, and the space bar lets the chicken jump. </p><p>Cars are coming at all speeds, so the key to the game is to avoid these very threatening obstacles. There is no space to sit idle on the highway, so timing and speed are crucial. Once you've passed the three-lane highway, you have almost no time to jump to safety on the river. Jumping is necessary when you get to the river -- you will need to jump on the moving logs. If you land in the water, your chicken drowns. These chickens can't swim.</p><p>What's your reward for getting your chicken safely onto a log? Another three-lane highway with cars once again colliding with you at high speeds that will kill your chicken.</p><p><strong>How did the chicken cross the road?</strong></p><p>Safe and fast. You can use the strategy of walking your chicken from the furthest point of traffic so they cross over safely before oncoming cars get a chance to hit the chicken, but you need to time it perfectly so they can jump on a river log. If you get too close to the end of the road, you risk no log appearing in time.</p><h3>How Go Chicken Go! Is Scored</h3><p>Your score will depend on the time you spend crossing along with other factors such as:</p><ul>\n<li>Successful crosses</li>\n<li>Total deaths</li>\n<li>Close calls</li>\n<li>Longest streaks</li>\n</ul><h3>Tips</h3><ul>\n<li>Caution is key, but don’t take too long. Jumping at the right moment could mean the difference between life and death.</li>\n<li>Feathers will give you a speed boost for a short time.</li>\n<li>Cars go fast and will change lanes without warning, so you may think you are safe in a lane with no cars in sight, but you can easily be swerved into by a car merging from another lane.</li>\n<li>If you stand too close to the edge as you wait to cross, you run the risk of being hit even if you think you’re out of reach. The chicken beek sticking out too much can lead to disaster.</li>\n</ul>"

Alternatively, they can develop a course designed for mayhem and creating a range of head on collisions using the ramps.</p><p>The landscapes used are reminiscent of Southern California and driving through your creation feels like you have spent years in the United States. Next, we look at the game controls. </p><h3>Using the in-game controls</h3><p>At first, the game controls may feel difficult to use. The WASD keys are used to move the camera view. Moreover, use the right-click mouse button to rotate the camera. </p><p>To select an object simply click it from the toolbar menu and click it again to place it on the map. To rotate an object, first click on it - the object will turn red and a rotate and remove icon will appear. </p><p>Each item can be placed and rotated individually. Road sections automatically join together which can help prevent wrong tracks being created. Ensure the road sections create a logical circuit to prevent vehicles headed in the wrong direction from crashing.</p><h3>Available vehicles</h3><p>Once a player has created their map, they can test it out or share it with others. Pulling off some awesome wrong way crashes or close race finishes is a great thrill, especially on your own map. The following vehicles are available for players to drive in:</p><ul>\n<li>Mercedes AMG</li>\n<li>Porsche 911</li>\n<li>Aston Martin</li>\n<li>Nissan GT</li>\n<li>Pick-up truck</li>\n</ul><p>The cars all have fantastic detail and look superb. Furthermore, they handle realistically and attain some scary top speeds. If the national highway traffic safety administration saw how you can drive with these cars, they would be outraged! </p><p>Give Wrong Way driving game a try today. See what amazing creations you can make and what daring and challenging track designs your mind can produce. Become a driving legend today and make your own dream course!</p><h3>Release Date</h3><p>October 2019</p><h3>Developer</h3><p>Wrong Way is made by Roberto Mulas (Ciorbyn).

    "faq": "<div><h3>How to play Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks?</h3><div><p>Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks combines solitaire gameplay but with some twists—you need to rank cards in descending or ascending order, and suits don't count!</p></div></div><div><h3>Do you have to match suits in Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks?</h3><div><p>You do not need to match suits in Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks.</p></div></div>",
    "controls": "",
    "how_to_play": "<p>The aim of the game is to match cards by rank. Tap a card that is either one rank higher or lower than the card you are working from. For example, if you have a 5, you can play a 6 or a 4. This sequence can continue in either direction (e.g., 4 → 5 → 6 or 6 → 5 → 4).</p><p><strong>The Table Setup</strong></p><p>The game begins with a dynamic layout of cards on the table, blending uncovered cards. You can play with covered cards waiting to be revealed. Your objective is to build sequences using only the uncovered cards, so strategize carefully to unlock new possibilities.</p><p>At the bottom of the game board, you’ll find your home base card, the foundation of your sequences. Every move you make starts here, guiding your progress through the game. Next to your home base is the deck of cards, your lifeline when you run out of moves on the table. Draw from this deck to refresh your strategy and keep the game moving forward.</p><p>Pay close attention to how the cards are arranged, and start planning your moves to reveal hidden opportunities and outsmart the deck!</p><p>Suits don’t matter, so you can match cards regardless of their suit, focusing solely on their numerical value.</p><p>The key to winning is to strategize your moves. It’s often best to start with a lower-numbered card so you have more flexibility to build sequences. Aim to clear as many cards as possible with each move by carefully planning increases and decreases (e.g., a sequence like 4 → 5 → 4 → 6 removes multiple cards).</p><p>If no moves are available, you will be prompted to draw a card from the deck. The card you draw becomes the new card you must build from. If no uncovered cards are playable, you’ll also need to draw from the deck.</p><p>The game becomes more challenging as you go. Occasionally, you may receive prompts to add five more cards to the table, increasing the difficulty. If you make a move you regret, use the Undo button to revise your strategy.</p><h3>Kings and Queens Solitaire TriPeaks Tip</h3><p>If you have several sequence options, prioritize moves that remove the most cards from the table or deck. For example, a sequence like 4 → 5 → 4 → 6 can clear more cards than a straight increase like 4 → 5 → 6.</p>"

Keep an eye on your speedometer, located at the bottom-right corner, to adjust your pace and avoid spinning out on tight bends.</p><p>One of the standout features of Super Star Car is its multiple view modes. You can race from a bird' s-eye view, chase your car from behind, or fully immerse yourself in the action by switching to the driver’s seat view. This versatility lets you experience the game from different perspectives, adding to its excitement and variety.</p><p>The heart of the game lies in its career mode, where every win brings you closer to the coveted championship trophy.

That means you'll need to balance your responsibilities and learn the timings to get the best scores and tips from your customers.</p><h4>Buy upgrades</h4><p>Papa demands that you use the tips to buy restaurant upgrades rather than on your own leisurely activities. You have the option to buy upgrades after each level is completed. The shop features items to help improve customer waiting times (like a television), lamps that keep burgers warm, and many other items to spend your hard-earned cash on.</p><h4>Snoop on your clientele</h4><p>Papa keeps a profile on all of his most prized customers.

You can send your population to them if you latch onto their building, forming a path from you to them.

Circular buildings build your own structures at a faster speed.</p><p>If you outnumber the enemy or neutral building’s occupants, you take control and increase your population further.

Link blue buildings to blue buildings as much as possible to strengthen your community. </p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Capture as many buildings as early as possible. The key to winning is capturing as many buildings as possible at the start to grow your population faster than your opponents.</p><p>Making the right connections is key! Circular buildings help heal allied buildings faster, while triangular buildings deal more damage to enemy structures. Use them strategically to gain an advantage in battle.</p><p>You can \"freeze\" your opponent's time, which gives you an advantage. You will need to watch an ad to do so, but it is worth it on the more challenging rounds.</p>"

You can put on various masks for your chickens, such as Noob, zombies, demons, cats, and more. Tired of chicken? Swap them out for a Banana Cat or Noobidi Toilet that makes toilet paper instead of eggs. You can also buy a dinosaur whose eggs are bigger and more expensive to sell! Build your chicken farm in different locations, like in a forest, under the sea, or even in hell. Compete with other chicken breeders to see who manages the best chicks!",

Nail the shot, and you’ll be launched across the hoop, celebrating your victory with a dance alongside other players.</p><p>In the second round, you’ll team up with another basketball player, still aiming for just one hoop. But in the third round, things get more intense as you aim for three-point shooting success. Now, you’ll have three hoops at different distances—the farther you sink the shot, the higher the score. By round 4, you'll be shooting from the beach! The pace picks up, and so do the rewards, both in gameplay and points. Dunk as many as you can and watch your player soar. Round 5 ups the challenge with hoops that move up and down, making timing your shots even trickier. Round 6 keeps the pressure on with rotating basketball posts. Get creative, shoot fast, and aim for those multi-shot combos!</p><p>Some hoops are blocked, but all it takes is breaking through the barrier to nail your shot.</p><p>The levels get more challenging but increase in fun as well. Keep shooting as much as possible and gain an advantage over your opponent to become a three-point shooting basketball champ.</p>"

Chapter 2 begins to get trickier immediately, with new obstacles such as lava introduced to quickly keep you on your toes, forcing you to practice your jumps. Chapter 3 is the real test of your stickman's strength—this is where you and a giant zombie will battle to the finish. You may have to repeat this round several times to get enough rewards to unlock the rest of the rounds.</p><p>With a wide array of 72 different armor options, you can customize your stickman’s defense to withstand even the toughest of foes. The right combination of armor will give you a tactical advantage, making you an unstoppable force.

    "description": "Tongits is a three-player card game that is still in the Rummy family. The objective of the game is to empty your hand cards by forming sets(melds) or minimize the total score when a fight is called or when the central stack is empty. Each player will be dealt 12 cards while the dealer gets 13, and the rest of the cards are left as a draw card. The game begins when the dealer dumps a card. The next person can either pick up the disposed card if that card makes a set or adds to a set they already have or get one from the central stack. Collect hand combinations and dump unnecessary cards. The picking and discarding of cards goes on until someone wins by Tongits, calls a fight, or until the central stack runs out of cards. If this happens, the players tally the points of the cards they have in hand, and the one with the lowest wins. To call a fight, the player needs to put down a meld on the table, and no player drops any card on any of their melds in that round. If the player can use all of their cards in combinations by connecting to opponents’ or the exposed card sets, or if the player gets rid of all their cards, then the player wins by Tongits. Have fun with your friends, enjoy exciting moments, and relieve your stress every day!",

The aim of the game is fairly simple - you need to match sets of three tiles of the same suit. </p><p>You'll start with a colorful array of fruit-themed tiles—grapes, watermelon, apples, cherries, and more. Click on each tile, and it will fall into the tile holder section. Once you get three matching tiles in the tile holder, they will disappear to make room for more. Early levels keep things simple, as all tiles are the same, making it easy to match a set of three. As the levels continue, the challenges get harder.</p><p>Your tile holder is where the magic happens, and it is the part that requires the most strategy. The tile holder holds up to 7 tiles—if the holder fills up with unmatched tiles, the game is over! You will need to make sure you get as many similar tiles as possible, so be careful what you click on.</p><p>As you progress, the challenge ramps up. Tiles become layered, so you’ll need to think strategically about which ones to free up first. If you grab too many unmatched tiles, you might run out of space before completing your sets. Plan ahead, keep an eye on your available space, and aim for those perfect matches to clear the board!</p>"

Watch out, here we come, fork!</p><p>As you advance deeper into the game, you'll face increasingly challenging levels that push your skills to the limit. These levels require more precise coordination as the obstacles get more challenging to jump through and over. You may find your sausage stuck in the sharp, appliance-filled world of the modern kitchen with no room to jump!</p><h3>Fork N Sausage Coins</h3><p>As you reach the fork, you will be surrounded by coins. Collect all the coins you can in the levels to save up for cool new accessories—sunglasses, a top hat, boxing gloves, a chef’s cap, and dozens more collectible items guaranteed to make your sausage look good enough to eat.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>Grab keys whenever you can to flip plates and get further cool rewards 🎁. You’ll also get the chance to spin the wheel for more coins or mystery prizes.</p>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>There are several challenges you can choose from at the start of the game, all of which are quite different from each other but have a common thread - the simple physical movements with very big repercussions. You can choose from various gameplays:</p><h3><strong>Bow and Arrow</strong></h3><p>Your ragdoll is standing on a ledge with a bow and arrow. Rotate your arms clockwise or counterclockwise, point, shoot, and aim. You won't always get your opponent to fall off the game screen when struck. Depending on the intensity of the hit, you may need a few arrows. Each challenge gets harder with ragdolls at various points on the game screen.</p><h3><strong>Dynamite</strong></h3><p>This challenge can be trickier. Your ragdoll's mission is to grab dynamite and throw it towards your opponent. Are you throwing it too far, too close, over the edge? You must find that perfect balance of rotating your hands, grabbing the object, and letting go to get to the next challenge. Easier said than done.</p><h3><strong>Simple Arrow</strong></h3><p>Click the play button at the start of the game, and you will be equipped with a simple arrow. This challenge will teach you the basics of this game. The arrow and movements very much mirror that of the Dynamite challenge.</p><h3><strong>Basketball</strong></h3><p>You aim to dunk the ball in the hoop. How much force is needed to shoot, and how far should you be before letting go of the ball? Practice makes perfect in this challenge.</p><h3><strong>Cannon</strong></h3><p>Hold, release, and fire! You will shoot your ragdoll out of a cannon and get him safely on a platform. Don't be afraid to hit him against other platforms to lose a bit of force and gain a bit of direction - all for the sake of physics! </p><h3>Release Date</h3><ul>\n<li>August 2019 (Android)</li>\n<li>May 2021 (iOS)</li>\n<li>May 2024 (WebGL)</li>\n</ul><h3>Platforms</h3><ul>\n<li>Web browser (desktop and mobile)</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>iOS</li>\n</ul>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>The concept of Sort Parking is fairly straightforward. You need to use logic to park cars of a similar color in one row, ensuring that no odd car is blocked in the parking lot between unmatching colors. The gameplay has a logical, pattern-based structure reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.crazygames.com/t/mahjong\" target=\"_blank\">Mahjong</a>, where each move affects the options that follow.</p><p>The game begins with cars of various colors parked all together. You will have a row with mixed car colors: brown, red, yellow, and blue, but you aim to get the same color car parked all in the same row, so all red cars parked in one row, brown cars parked in one row, and so on.</p><p>There are a few empty rows—these are the ones that you need to be strategic about filling. Once you place one color in an empty row, you will have to add the same color to that very row. Cars cannot be placed in front of different-colored cars, so once you start a row, make sure you have a plan to fill it.</p><p>When you fill an entire row with one color, that row is locked in. Lock them all in and complete the stage. </p><p><strong>Earn More Points</strong></p><p>Once you clear a stage, you can increase your points by clicking on the highest rotating number. It seems easy enough, but those numbers rotate pretty quickly.</p><p><strong>What Can You Do With Your Points?</strong></p><p>You can unlock more car models with in-game coins. Clear stages to collect pieces for the background; when matched, you can change the background to a new theme.</p>"

This is an auto battler game where you must manage your fighters by strategically equipping different items and artifacts to assemble the strongest team possible in order to win the battle. Send them off to fight against AI opponents in single-player or against other human players online. By combining certain types of items, you can increase your strength or counter the opponents' strategies. Collect money after each battle and use it to level up and buy new equipment for your fighters. You can also buy multiple of the same items to combine them into stronger versions. Each item belongs to two different sets. If you collect multiples of the same set, you get additional set bonuses. Your fighters will automatically run out and fight for you with the equipment you have assigned to them. The loser of the battle will lose health, and if you go down to 0 health, you are out of the game. The last player standing is the winner!",

On the right side of the screen, select a weapon to destroy your chosen planet. For example, you can choose an alien monster drill to create a donut-like hole in the center of Mars. Or, if the planet is rotating close enough to you, you may want to detonate a bomb. Say goodbye to one or all seven continents with a few consistent laser shots. Want to practice your aim? Send a rocket out to see just how much you can destroy in one go.</p><p>The more planets you destroy, the more money you earn. Currency will get you upgrades and new planets to explore via a store purchase, allowing you to destroy even more worlds.</p><p>You can tweak your weapons via settings. You might enlarge your laser beam and change its color, make meteorites hit a wider area, move faster, or expand the blast radius of missiles. You can even unleash dozens of missiles for those peskier planets that are more difficult to destroy.</p>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>The objective of the game is simply to have fun and be creative, giving your style to a blank Chibi canvas. You get to choose from a series of options - and there are many - thousands, in fact!</p><p><strong>Hair</strong> </p><p>Choose from 75 hairstyles and endless colors. Hairstyles include bob, pixie, crew cut, buzz cut, undercut, fade, mohawk, mullet, shag, layered cut, blunt cut, asymmetrical cut, bowl cut, tapered cut, and side part. The best part is you can choose from 50 set colors. Can’t find the color you want? Create your own with a rainbow palette.</p><p><strong>Headpieces </strong></p><p>Doll your Chibi up with cat ears, a witch hat, bows, a birthday hat, a top hat, bunny ears, a crown, a Viking hat, and a baseball hat. The sky’s the limit.</p><p><strong>Eyes</strong></p><p>You have a vast array of eyes to choose from in red, blue, green, and all sorts of shapes and sizes. Want something beyond conventional?

They have a lot more detail than the other clothing pieces and include lots of designs such as capes, blazers, oversized sweaters, and knitwear. Bundle Chibi up if they’re going out in cool weather.</p><p><strong>Pants</strong></p><p>Choose from jeans, dress pants, cargo pants, sweatpants, joggers, leggings, harem pants, cargo shorts, denim shorts, and running shorts, or opt for some mismatching patterns for that extra pizzazz.</p><p><strong>Other Customizations</strong></p><p>You can also customize your Chibi with various eyebrows, dresses, shoes, and more.</p><h3>Download Unique Chibi Doll Scenarios</h3><p>There’s no need to stop at the conventional.

Your goal is to click and generate balls within this circle. You’ll start with a limited supply of balls, but they can gradually increase over time. The key is to keep as many balls bouncing inside the circle as possible, as each bounce increases their value. However, the circle rotates unpredictably, and the balls won’t always stay where you want them, making it tricky to control their movements.</p><p>As you advance through the game, watch for opportunities to supercharge your ball supply and skyrocket your earnings. Spot an x3 multiplier? Don’t hesitate—click it to triple your bounce points for a limited time instantly. From there, aim your balls with precision to hit the most valuable sections of the circle, racking up massive points and taking your score to new heights!</p><p>You’ll have the option to upgrade different elements, including adding more balls, boosting your income, widening the gap, or even creating additional circles. Each upgrade is locked until you’ve earned enough points, so strategy is key to unlocking more powerful features.</p><p>As the game advances, the difficulty ramps up. You'll encounter multiple rotating circles and balls that move faster with each level, challenging you to master timing, placement, and the physics of their bouncing patterns.</p>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>The game starts with you as a security guard in a prison, requiring plenty of work. There are few jail cells with doors and no toilets, and the prison is in dire need of handcuffs and leg shackles, just in case of a prison break! You aim to keep up with the number of prisoners that are detained, increasing your security staff along with administrative staff and collect as much money as possible to make this all happen!</p><h3>Prison Break Battle </h3><p>The game is broken up into \"days\". Each day is defined by a battle - or a potential prison break. There is a green button on the side of the screen labeled battle. Tap it for the final challenge of the day, where all prisoners escape, and the only thing you can do to protect yourself is neutralize them into submission and carry them back off to their cells. This will not only get you to the next day but will also give you a hefty jackpot of rewards if you survive the prison break!</p><p>It is vital that you spend your money wisely to survive these prison breaks. Increase security to the max by adding the heaviest shackles and most secure handcuffs and upgrading your weapon as much as you can afford. This will ensure you can out beat the prison break, especially when you are further along, and multiple cells are filled to capacity. It's impossible to defeat the prisoners otherwise.</p><p><strong>Hire more staff</strong></p><p>The further along you are in days, and the more money you have collected and reinstated in prison repairs, the more security guards you will need and be able to hire. Your security guards will fight prison breaks right alongside you. </p><p><strong>Not all prisoners are alike</strong></p><p>Spend your money on repairs for current prisoners and in preparation for future prisoners. Most prisoners are of average strength and capacity, but the more you progress in the game, the more interesting your prisoners become. They will eventually come in all shapes and sizes and will have difficult combat skills. Get your upgrades at the front office in capacity, speed, and strength. You can also upgrade your weapon, which is strongly recommended.</p>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>Your goal in Splatman is to outmaneuver and defeat your opponents in a tight arena by ambushing them with high-speed paint blasts from your weapon. You start by choosing the number of players on your team—you can go solo or team up with a partner, both playing from the same keyboard. If you're feeling bold, you can even control both characters yourself to double the challenge!</p><p>Once you enter the arena, don't stay in one spot for too long. Like any great arena game, offense is key, so keep moving to gain the upper hand. Try to corner your opponents, but remember—staying on the move makes you a harder target. If you find yourself on the defensive, use obstacles in the center of the arena to avoid direct hits.</p><p>Customize your gameplay by upgrading to new paint colors or more powerful paint guns. As you accumulate rewards and points, you'll unlock better equipment, with upgrades starting at 2,000 coins. It may take a few games to build up enough currency, but the right upgrades can significantly boost your chances of victory.</p><p>Keep an eye on key stats like health, damage, and rate of fire to see where you might need an upgrade. If your fire rate is slowing you down, consider investing in a faster, more powerful paint gun to dominate the competition!</p>"

Once you have the hang of it, you're on your own. But not to worry, help from your advisors is just a click away.</p><p>Julia and Flavius guide you through the following directions:</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"Welcome to the city, Prefect! I’m Julia. I run an inn here, and I know everything about everyone. This is Flavius, the architect.\"</p><p><strong>Flavius: </strong>\"My projects can do the talking for me! The first one is a residential building. Let’s get to work!\"</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"Remember, every building in the city must be connected to a road.\"</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> You get to build a road.</p><p><strong>Flavius: </strong>\"Congratulations, Prefect! The building is ready. We can house people in it now.\"</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"People?! There’s barely room for one citizen. The building needs to be upgraded.\"</p><p><strong>Action: </strong>Build a house.</p><p><strong>Flavius: </strong>\"Prefect, we have a problem. We need clay to make the house more spacious, but it’s mined outside the city.\"</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> \"If it’s even mined at all! The clay quarry is in bad shape, and the tool storage is totally dilapidated. But our Prefect can solve that, right?\"</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Fix the clay quarry.</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"Now we can hire a manager! But that can happen later. First, we need to build a road to deliver the clay to the city.\"</p><p><strong>Action: </strong>Build a road.</p><p><strong>Flavius:</strong> \"The road is wonderful, Prefect! Collect the mined clay, and my people will deliver it to the construction site right away.\"</p><p><strong>Action: </strong>Collect the clay.</p><p><strong>Flavius:</strong> \"Thank you for the help. I’ll get to work upgrading the house right now!\"</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> \"You and Flavius are doing wonderfully! Let’s upgrade another house. It could use a second floor, with a good view of the city.\"</p><p><strong>Flavius: </strong>\"Regular clay isn’t enough to build another floor. This requires a sturdier material, such as clay mixture.\"</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"Alas, this material isn’t produced in our city. Although the Prefect could give orders to build a special workshop.\"</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"If you don’t want to wait, use gems! Their shine speeds up any project. The first time is free, though.\"</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Use gems.</p><p><strong>Flavius: </strong>\"Very grand, Prefect. Now we won’t lack building materials. Give the order to produce clay mixture.\"</p><p><strong>Julia:</strong> \"Production can take a long time. When it ends, a clay mixture icon will appear above the workshop.\"</p><p><strong>Action: </strong>Wait for production to finish.</p><p><strong>Flavius: </strong>\"It’s ready, Prefect! Tap the icon to move the mixture to the warehouse.\"</p><p><strong>Action:</strong> Move the mixture to the warehouse.</p><p><strong>Julia: </strong>\"So, are we going to upgrade the house or just pretend that it’s intentionally unfinished?\"</p><p><strong>Flavius:</strong> \"Please accept this scroll. I sketched out some improvements. Remember, Prefect, Julia and I are always here to support you!\"</p><p>You're on your own after this training.

    "how_to_play": "<p>In Gladiator Fights, your mission is clear: fight to the death in brutal arenas set in ancient Rome. You'll use the arrow keys to move around the battlefield, positioning yourself for the best chance of survival. Attacking is simple—press Q or E/R to unleash your weapon of choice. Combat is fast and intense. Use left-click to attack with your sword and right-click to fire arrows. Each battle is a test of both skill and strategy, and you'll need to stay sharp to outmaneuver your enemies.</p><p>There are several battle modes to choose from. In Custom Battles, you can set up your own matchups, whether it’s a classic one vs. one duel, a chaotic three vs. three fight, or even a daring one vs. two challenge for the ultimate test of skill. For a more structured experience, enter the Tournaments, where you'll fight your way through ten grueling rounds, each one more difficult than the last, as you strive to become the ultimate gladiator champion. There's also a Rating Battle mode where you'll face off in ranked duels, battling to climb the leaderboard and prove your dominance.</p><p>Weapons in Gladiator Fights vary from swords and hammers to axes and arrows, each offering a unique fighting style. Some weapons are so large that you won’t be able to carry a shield, so you’ll need to rely on agility and timing to defend yourself. Your enemies are armed with their own deadly tools, so always keep an eye on what they’re wielding. To avoid arrows, the best defense is to simply dodge—quick movements will save you from certain death. If you’re up against a sword-wielding opponent, use your shield to block their attacks. And if you find yourself facing fire, your best option is to run!</p><p>The key to survival is staying on the offense—if you hesitate, your enemies will strike first, or worse, the battle will drag on with no clear winner. There's no place to hide, and the only way out is to eliminate every opponent in your path. Stay aggressive, adapt to your enemies' tactics, and fight your way to glory!</p>"

Completing tasks not only rewards you but also elevates your status as mayor, unlocking new opportunities and growth for your city.</p><p>As your city grows, connecting with fellow mayors becomes essential. Create a union and invite others to join, fostering a community where you can exchange resources, tackle challenges together, and discuss city issues openly. This collaboration can help you overcome obstacles and bring prosperity to all members.</p><p>A bustling city is a profitable one. Collect taxes from commercial buildings to expand your city’s territory, build new infrastructure, and grow your population. As your reputation and resources grow, you’ll have the opportunity to construct more advanced buildings, meet the rising demands of your citizens, and create a city that’s uniquely yours in Steam City.</p>"

Money rains down from the sky—truly a dream come true—but most of it starts in small amounts, just single dollars. To grow your wealth, you'll need to make the most of the eight obstacles on your screen, each temporarily catching the falling money and boosting its value. Some obstacles add a fixed amount, like +1, while others multiply your earnings, such as x1.1 or x2. For example, if a dollar hits the +1 obstacle, you earn an extra dollar, but hitting x1.1 will increase your total by 10%.</p><p>You start with blank slots that you’ll need to fill strategically. Place bumper chips in the most effective spots to maximize your returns, and use the bumper button to acquire new chips that add value. As you play, you can unlock additional slots by watching ads or earning enough money to open prime real estate. The $5k chip, for example, speeds up your progress, but getting there requires smart planning and precise placement.</p><p>Your ultimate goal is to earn $250k and advance to the next round. Each new level brings more challenges and demands smarter decisions. With careful strategy, well-placed multipliers, and a bit of patience, you’ll turn those falling dollars into a mountain of wealth.</p>"

    "how_to_play": "<p>Welcome to your new farm! You’ve just acquired Roadside Farm, or whatever name you choose, and it’s time to embrace farm life. But first, here’s a letter from the previous owner that will give you an idea of your situation:</p><p><em>Hi,</em></p><p><em>Congrats on buying my farm! Sorry to hear you got stranded overnight - wish I could’ve helped fix your car. I don’t remember that rock being on the road… strange. Anyway, I asked around for help, and hopefully, you’ll find an oil pan soon.</em></p><p><em>You were right about the sunrises - they're stunning, much better than in the city! The soil here is top-notch too. Too bad I had to leave in such a rush. Life happens...</em></p><p><em>This land is the best spot on that flat hilltop, right near the road. It’s called Roadside Farm, but feel free to rename it. Oh, and please take care of Clarabella!</em></p><p><em>Best Wishes,</em></p><p><em>Jim Grey</em></p><p>Now that you’re settling in, it’s time to start farming. Each day brings new rewards, so be sure to check in and claim them. The key to a thriving farm is planting, harvesting, and managing your resources wisely. Sow your seeds, take care of your animals, and keep an eye on your barn and warehouse to track what you’ve gathered. As you grow your farm, you’ll have the chance to expand your land, unlocking even more opportunities to cultivate crops and raise livestock.</p><p>Clover is an essential crop for your animals. Cows, turkeys, and goats love it, and if you have bees, they’ll pollinate it, producing honey before harvest. Clover is also used in the production of milk, black feathers, and white feathers. Wheat is another staple: grind it at the Dutch Mill to make flour or use it to feed your sheep. It’s a key ingredient in making flour, vodka, wool, and black wool. If you need milk, make sure to feed your Holstein cows. A full cow is a happy cow, and happy cows keep your farm running smoothly.</p><p>Your farm has several important buildings to manage. The Dutch Mill turns wheat into flour, and keeping it filled will power the windmill. The barn stores essentials like wheat, clover, and flour, while the warehouse holds resources such as honey, sugar, oxygen, and propane. As you progress, you’ll gain access to even more supplies, including gear, decorations, chests, and medals. Keep an eye on your stockpile to prepare for the next task.</p><p>While ripe crops are beautiful to look at, don’t forget to harvest and replant to keep your farm productive. Wheat should always be replenished, and replanting clover on eight plots of soil will ensure a steady supply. Adding sacks of wheat to the Dutch Mill will keep your flour production running smoothly. The more you maintain your farm, the more opportunities you’ll unlock, allowing you to expand even further. Check the map to see just how vast your farm can become.</p><p>Beyond the daily farm routine, there are plenty of ways to engage with the world around you. If you enjoy a relaxed farming experience, you’ll love the peaceful rhythm of planting and harvesting, accompanied by soothing animations and calming sounds. For those who like a challenge, competitions, achievements, horse racing, and leaderboards offer ways to test your skills and earn permanent prizes. The farming co-op lets you collaborate with fellow players, whether by sending Wedding Doves to ceremonies or trading produce at the Market.</p><p>Neighbors are a valuable part of farm life. The more neighbors you have, the more gifts you’ll receive, helping you progress faster. You can also personalize your farm with beautiful artwork and decorations, customizing both your Farmhouse and Log Cabin. If you feel like exploring, venture into the surrounding landscapes to forage for mushrooms and edible roots, or head to the mines to uncover valuable ores and hidden riches.</p><p>With so much to do, you can play Country Life Meadows your way. Relax and unwind with hours of farming fun, compete to showcase your skills, or grow your farm into a flourishing empire. The possibilities are endless: so start planting and watch your farm come to life!</p><h3>Features</h3><ul>\n<li>Play to Relax: Unwind with hundreds of hours of farming fun. Revel in the soothing daily routine of planting and harvesting your crops, complete with beautiful animations and calming sounds.</li>\n<li>Play to Compete: Test your skills in Competitions, Achievements, Horse Racing, and Leaderboards.

    "controls": "<p>Use WASD to control your character and press the space button to release the disc.</p>",
    "how_to_play": "<p>Your Battle DISC task is fairly straightforward—toss the disc to your opponent's end and destroy the protected barriers. There is no \"goal\" in this classic sports court game, but you and your opponent are looking to protect blocks behind you. Once the disc hits these blocks, they shatter, and when the opponent shatters all of them, you lose the match.</p><p>The first few levels are easy. Some disc throws actually hit all of your opponent's blocks, making a win with one shot very possible. As you advance in levels, the challenges increase. There will gradually be more opponent blocks to destroy. Some levels include bombs which, when you hit, you can destroy multiple blocks in one go with the explosion.</p><p>Every so often, you will get to open a \"lucky box.\" Sometimes, you need to watch an ad, but you can opt out and claim your prize later in levels. Lucky boxes contain rewards that help you buy upgrades like more people to your squad, a group to cheer you on, more potent discs, or a bundle of all three.</p><p>Some of the challenges you can expect are multiple opponents defending their blocks, moving blocks, changing arenas, and more.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>Your aim is important. Catching the disc is even more important.</p><p>Much like billiards, you need to know your angles and aim and shoot your target. You will often be met with a moving target or reactive \"goalkeepers,\" but it is vital you don't shoot aimlessly. All discs tossed will eventually come back your way with just as much force. Catch them before your opponents do. If you miss your toss, your opponents will catch them. Be reactive and get ready to defend and catch that disc when it makes its way back to you.</p>"

Each round will present you with an intricate structure filled with cakes, little creatures, diamond rewards, balloons, and more hidden between a structural foundation that can, and should, easily be destroyed. </p><p>Begin by clicking and holding the projectile in your slingshot, then pull back by dragging your mouse to adjust the angle and power of your shot. When ready, release to launch. But here’s the twist—some projectiles come with special effects! Click mid-air to trigger their unique abilities before they hit anything, adding an extra layer of strategy to your aim.</p><p>This physics-inspired game challenges your precision and creativity as you knock down increasingly complex towers to advance through levels. Start simple with stones and wooden structures, aiming for weak points or TNT barrels to cause a satisfying chain reaction of destruction. As the levels get harder, you'll need to carefully study each structure to find its Achilles' heel, with fewer projectiles at your disposal to make every shot count.</p><p>Strategy is everything. If there’s no TNT, aim for the base of the structure—it’s all about that base! Some objects require a smarter approach: target support beams to unbalance the tower or pop balloons holding parts of the structure afloat. The game rewards clever thinking and sharp aim, keeping every level fresh and challenging.</p><p>Are you ready to conquer gravity and bring down every fortress in your path? Grab your slingshot, take aim, and let the destruction begin!</p>"

The real trick is finding the perfect mix of speed and control. As you navigate the track, you'll need to dodge obstacles while collecting coins scattered along the way. The more coins you grab, the more rewards you unlock, including new rolling objects that are easier to control and give you a competitive edge.</p><p>For extra fun, jump into the 2-player mode and compete head-to-head with a friend! The race gets even wilder with more laughs and some serious competition. Keep your balance, avoid the falls, and master the curves to be the first to reach the finish line!</p>"

You'll encounter obstacles like slides and elevators, which add a fun element as you navigate through the level, taking you closer to the next challenge.</p><p>But you’re not alone in this race. Other players are also collecting blocks to build their own bridges, and they’re more than happy to challenge you along the way. If you’re not careful, your opponents can sabotage your progress by building over your bridge, undoing all the hard work you’ve done. And if you run out of blocks and need to return to collect more, be prepared for your opponents to steal your blocks, changing their color to match yours and forcing you to start the process over again. You’ll also have to watch out for being knocked down by other players, which causes you to lose all the blocks on your back.</p><p>Throughout the game, you’ll encounter rewards scattered across the map. Green rewards multiply the number of blocks you carry, giving you an advantage, while red ones will diminish your collection, so it’s important to avoid them at all costs. Stay vigilant, collect wisely, and you’ll be on your way to victory!</p>"

    "controls": "<p>Use the left mouse button to interact.</p>",
    "how_to_play": "<p>In TimeWarriors, your mission is to lead an evolving army through the ages, starting from the Stone Age. Your ability to deploy troops is directly tied to your food supply. For every three pieces of food, you can send out one soldier. This means you’ll need to manage your rations: stockpiling food carefully is your priority. At the start of the game, resources are scarce, but watching ads can give you a helpful boost, allowing you to send out more soldiers and gain an early advantage.</p><p>The key to winning battles is timing and strategy. Deploy your troops when you have enough food, overwhelming your opponent before they can strengthen their defenses. Early levels allow you to outpace your enemies by cutting off their stronger units, such as soldiers on horseback, before they even have a chance to leave their base. This tactic works particularly well in Level 1, where the enemy wields essential clubs in the Stone Age.</p><p>An example of soldier deployment is based on food at level 1:</p><ul>\n<li>1-2 pieces of food: No troops can be sent.</li>\n<li>3 pieces of food: Deploy one soldier.</li>\n<li>6 pieces of food: Deploy two soldiers, and so on.</li>\n</ul><p>As you progress into Level 2, the game shifts into the Farm Age, where your foes are equipped with shovels and better weaponry. To keep up, you’ll need to use the rewards you’ve earned to upgrade your army. Invest in advanced tools and weapons that match the technology of the age, but balance this with maintaining a steady flow of soldiers to ensure you’re not overwhelmed. The longer battles progress, the more critical it becomes to upgrade your troops and your base to increase food production and withstand enemy attacks.</p><p>Several upgrades can give you a significant edge in battle. A grindstone sharpens your soldiers’ weapons, allowing them to inflict more damage, while a war banner rallies your troops to fight harder as a unified force. You can also invest in faster food production to deploy soldiers at a quicker pace or increase your base health to hold out against enemy assaults.</p><p>Victory in TimeWarriors depends on finding the perfect balance between attacking, defending, and resource management. With each successful battle, you’ll move closer to mastering the game’s historical ages. From the Stone Age(70,000–20,000 BC), where tools and settlements were in their infancy, to the Farm Age (12,000–4,000 BC), where agriculture and domestication laid the foundation for civilizations, every level challenges you to adapt and evolve. Lead your army wisely, and you’ll rewrite history with your conquests!</p>"

Your goal? Outrace your opponent to the finish line—but how you get there is entirely up to your imagination.</p><p>To move, you'll need to draw “legs” for your block. A small pad at the bottom center of the screen lets you sketch out any shape you want, and once you do, your block springs to life, moving according to the design. Need speed on flat terrain? Draw wheel-like legs. Climbing a steep wall? Try claws or hooks. Facing wide gaps? Long legs might just do the trick.</p><p>The fun part is you’re not locked into one design—you can switch up your leg shapes at any point during the course. But be careful: legs that are too long can get trimmed down in tight spaces, so balance is key.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong> </p><p>Experiment with different shapes and strategies to adapt to the terrain. At the end of each race, your final burst of speed determines how far you’ll launch—and the farther you fly, the more points you’ll rack up. Creativity, timing, and a bit of physics know-how are your best tools to come out on top.</p>"
